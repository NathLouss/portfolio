        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Parisian by birth, I left at 24 with a masterâ€™s degree in management in my pocket and a one-way ticket to New Caledonia. For 7 years, I worked in an import and distribution company, becoming an expert in administrative and commercial management.
          When I arrived in the Bordeaux region, I needed a change. After training as a self-taught and professional, I received several awards and started as an entrepreneur in creative event baking.
          Undermined by the year 2020, I decided to bounce back by learning the code with the Wagon Bordeaux.
          I want to continue my professional reconversion through the double course "Apprentis Tech" in partnership with OpenClassrooms. I am looking for a company to carry out a work-study in contract of professionalization of a duration of 2 years.
